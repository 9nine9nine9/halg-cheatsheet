A cheatsheet for the Honours Algebra course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. A separate PDF is generated containing all exercises.

Latest versions can be found in the Releases tab (or [here](https://github.com/9nine9nine9/halg-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/main.pdf) for the theorems, and [here](https://github.com/9nine9nine9/halg-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/exercises.pdf) for the exercises).
