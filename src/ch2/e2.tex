\subsection{Basic Properties of Matrices}
\item Show that there is a group isomorphism between $\GL(2; \mathbb{F}_{2})$ and $S_{3}$, where $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ is the field with two elements $\{0, 1\}$ and $S_{3}$ the symmetric group on 3 letters.
\item Is the group $\GL(1, F_{p})$ abelian? What is its order?
\item What is the centre (FPM 5.2.4) of $\GL(n, \mathbb{F})$ for arbitrary $F$? What is the order of the centre of $\GL(n, \mathbb{F}_{p})$?
\item show that the column rank of a matrix $A \in \Mat(n \times m; F)$ equals the rank of the linear mapping $(A \circ) : F^{m} \to F^{n}$.
\item Find a $3 \times 3$ matrix with all entries non-zero integers but which has rank 2.
\item Let $A, B \in \Mat(m \times n, F)$. Show that $\rank(A + B) \le \rank A + \rank B$ (that rank is subadditive).
\item Let $A, B \in \Mat(m \times n, F)$. Show that $\rank(AB) \le min(\rank A, \rank B)$.
\item Let $B \in \Mat(n \times r; F)$ where $r = \rank B$. Show that there exists $E \in \Mat(r \times n; F)$ such that $EB=1_{r}$. Similarly, let $C \in \Mat(r \times n; F)$ where $\rank C = r$. Then there exists $H \in \Mat(n \times r; F)$ such that $CH=1_{r}$.
\item Let $A \in \Mat(m \times n; F)$ have rank $r$. Show that $A = BC$ where $B \in \Mat(m \times r; F)$ has rank $r$ and $C \in \Mat(r \times n; F)$ has rank $r$. Is this decomposition unique? Hence or otherwise show that $A$ may be expressed as the sum of $r$ rank 1 matrices.
