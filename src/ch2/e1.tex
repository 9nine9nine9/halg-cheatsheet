\subsection{Linear Mappings and Matrices}
\item Show that the mapping $M$ from thm2.1.1 is even an isomorphism of vector spaces, where we use the vector space structures defined in ex15 for linear mappings and ex1 for matrices.
\item Let $f : \mathbb{R}^{2} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}$ be the reflection $(x, y) \mapsto (x, -y)$ as in ex14. Show that $\{g \in \Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \mathbb{R}^{2}) | f \circ g = g \circ f\}$ is a subspace of $\Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{2}, \mathbb{R}^{2})$  and give a basis of this subspace.
\item Given a matrix $A \in \Mat(n \times m; F)$ define the transposed matrix $A^{T} \in \Mat(m \times n; F)$ by the rule $(A^{T})_{ij} = A_{ji}$. I refer to that by saying that $A^{T}$ is obtained from $A$ by ``reflection about the main diagonal''. Show that $(A^{T})^{T} = A$, and further that $(AB)^{T} = B^{T} A^{T}$.
