\wde{2.2.1 Invertible} A square matrix $A$ is \emph{invertible} if there exist matrices $B, C$ s.t. $BA = I = AC$. If $A$ is invertible and $a : F^{n} \iso F^{n}$ is its VS isomorphism, then $[a^{-1}]$ is the inverse matrix $B$ s.t. $AB = I = BA$. The invertible $(n \times n)$ matrices in $F$ form the \emph{general linear group of $(n \times n)$ matrices}, denoted $\GL(n; F) = \Mat(n; F)^{\times}$.
\wde{2.2.2 Elementary Matrix} A matrix that differs from the identity matrix in at most one entry.
\wt{2.2.3} Every square matrix in $F$ can be written as a product of elementary matrices.
