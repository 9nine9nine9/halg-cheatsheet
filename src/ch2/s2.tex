\wde{2.2.1 Invertible} A square matrix $A$ is \emph{invertible} if there exist matrices $B, C$ s.t. $BA = I = AC$. If $A = [a]$ is invertible and $a : F^{n} \iso F^{n}$ is its VS isomorphism, then $[a^{-1}]$ is the inverse matrix $B$ s.t. $AB = I = BA$. The invertible $(n \times n)$ matrices in $F$ form the \emph{general linear group of $(n \times n)$ matrices}, denoted $\GL(n; F) = \Mat(n; F)^{\times}$.
\wde{2.2.2 Elementary Matrix} A matrix that differs from the identity matrix in at most one entry. Inverses (if they exist) are elementary too.
\wde{2.2.2ii Basis Matrix} $E_{ij}$ is the 0 matrix with a 1 in $(i, j)$. % helpful
\wt{2.2.3} Every square matrix in $F$ can be written as a product of elementary matrices.
\wde{2.2.4 Smith Normal Form} A matrix whose only non-zero entries lie on the diagonal, \& which has first 1s along the diagonal followed by 0s, is in SNF.
\wt{2.2.5 Transformation into SNF} For $A \in \Mat(n \times m; F)$ there exist invertible matrices $P$ and $Q$ s.t. $PAQ$ is in SNF.
\wde{2.2.7 Rank} The column rank of $A$ is the dimension of the subspace of $F^{n}$ generated by the columns of $A$. The row rank is similar. The rank of $A$ is denoted $\rk A$. When the rank equals the number of rows or columns, the matrix has \emph{full rank}.
\wt{2.2.8} The column and row rank of any matrix are equal.
