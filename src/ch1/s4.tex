\wde{1.4.1 Subspace} A subset $U$ of $V$ is a subspace if $U$ contains $\vec{0}$ \& is closed under $+$ \& $\cdot$. Alternatively, $U$ is a subspace if it can be given an $F$-vector space structure s.t. the embedding is a homomorphism of $F$-vector spaces.
\wde{Linear Combination} Let $T$ be a subset of $V$. Then, $\forall \alpha_{i} \in F$, $\alpha_{1}\vec{v}_{1} + \dots + \alpha_{n}\vec{v}_{n}$ is called a linear combination.
\wpr{1.4.5 Span} Amongst all subspaces of $V$ that include $T$ there exists a smallest subspace $\langle T \rangle = \langle T \rangle_{F} \subseteq V$, called the span. This is the linear combination of the elements of $T$.
\wde{1.4.7 Generating Set} $T$ is called a generating set if its span equals $V$. If $T$ is finite, then $V$ is finitely generated.
