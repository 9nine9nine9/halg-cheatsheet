\subsection*{1.6 Dimension of a Vector Space}
\item how that each one dimensional vector space has exactly two vector subspaces.
\item Given $F$-vector spaces $V_{1}, \dots, V_{n}$, show tha tthe dimension of their cartesian product (in the sense of section 1.3) is given by $\dim (V_{1} \oplus \dots \oplus V_{n}) = \dim V_{1} + \dots + \dim V_{n}$.
\item Recall that $\mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$. Thus we can think of any $\mathbb{C}$-vector space as a vector space over $\mathbb{R}$. Show that $\dim_{\mathbb{R}} V = 2 \dim_{\mathbb{C}} V$.
