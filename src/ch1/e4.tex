\subsection*{1.4 Vector Subspaces}
\item A subset of a vector space is called a (linear) \emph{hyperplane} if it is a proper subspace and such that it, together with one single further vector, generates the whole original vector space. show that a hyperplane togeter with any vector not in the hyperplane generates all of the original vector space.
\item Show that each intersection of vector subspaces of a vector space is again a vector subspace. Note tha tthis has the following consequence: for a subset $T$ of a vector space $V$ over $F$ the intersection of all vector subspaces of $V$ that contain $T$ is obviously the smallest vector subspace of $V$ that contains $T$. This provides us with a new proof of Prop. 1.4.5 on the existence of such a smalest subspace. This proof has the advantage that it is easier to generalise.
