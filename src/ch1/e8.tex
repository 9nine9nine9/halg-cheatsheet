\subsection*{1.8 Rank-Nullity Theorem}
\item Let $f : V \to W$ be a linear mapping. Show that if $v_{1}, \dots, v_{s}$ is a basis of the kernel $\ker f$ and $v_{s+1}, \dots, v_{n}$ an extension to a linearly independent subset of $V$, then the family $f(v_{s+1}), \dots, f(v_{n})$ is linearly independent in $W$. If the extension is moreover a basis of $V$, then show that $(f(v_{i}))_{s+1 \le i \le n}$ is a basis of the image of $f$. Use this to deduce another proof of the Rank-Nullity theorem in the finite dimensional case.
\item Show that two subspaces $U,W$ of a vector space $V$ are complementary iff. $V = U + W$ and $U \cap W = 0$.
\item Show that two subspaces $U,W$ of a finite dimensional vector space $V$ are complementary iff. $V = U + W$ and $\dim U + \dim W \le \dim V$.
\item Show that the kernel of a non-zero linear mapping $V \to F$ is a hyperplane, in the sense of ex3.
\item Let $\phi : V \to V$ be an endomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space $V$. Show that $\ker(\phi \circ \phi) = \ker \phi$ is equivalent to $V = \ker \phi \oplus \im \phi$.
\item An element $f$ of a set with composition or product is called an \emph{idempotent} if $f^{2} = f \circ f = f$. An example of a set with composition is $\Endo(V)$, the set of endomorphisms of a finite dimensional vector space $V$. By ex22 the idempotent endomorphims of $V$ correspond uniquely to decompositions of $V$ into a direct sum of two complementary subspaces. Show that the mapping $f \mapsto (\im f, \ker f)$ affords a bijection $\{f \in \Endo(V) | f^{2} = f\} \iso \{(I, K) \in \mathcal{P}(V)^{2} | I, K \subseteq V \text{ are vector subspaces with } I \oplus K = V\}$. The inverse of this bijection associates to the decomposition $V = I \oplus K$ the \emph{projection of $V$ onto $I$ along $K$}.
